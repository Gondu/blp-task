User Group Assignment - Coding Challenge

In this task, you'll get a chance to showcase your skills by improving a crucial part of our React app. This challenge is designed to reflect a real-world scenario you might face while working with us, offering you a glimpse into the kind of problems we solve every day.

Overview:
Our app includes a component that allows users to assign system users to user groups. As per the current design, users can be both assigned and removed from these groups. However, feedback and testing have shown us that the current way of assigning users to user groups isn't as intuitive or transparent as it should be.

That's where you come in.

Challenge:
Your task is to revamp the user-group assignment process. Using the existing framework and guided by the screenshots provided, you need to rewrite the assignment process to make it more intuitive and transparent. The challenge here is to simplify the user experience while ensuring the functionality is not compromised.

You have the freedom to approach this problem however you see fit. You could opt for a complete design overhaul or subtle changes to improve usability â€” the choice is yours. You can also change the mocked queries.

Expectations:
We don't want to limit your creativity and problem-solving approach with strict rules. We're interested in understanding how you think and how you write code.

The key things we will be looking for are:

- How well your solution addresses the problem
- The quality of your code
- Your consideration and approach towards enhancing the user experience

This is not a time-limited challenge, so take the time you need to come up with a thoughtful solution. The main goal is to have a discussion about your approach once you feel ready.

Support:
Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or need any clarifications during the course of the challenge. We're here to help and want to ensure you have the best possible opportunity to succeed.

Submission:
When you're ready to submit your solution, get in contact with us and we talk about the next steps.
